This repository contains the python code used for my Bocconi MSc Thesis on FX TARFs pricing.

The code will 

1. Interpolate Implied Volatility Surface through Gatheral (2004) SVI model

2. Fit local volatility surface

3. Calibrate Heston Model parameters (kappa, m, eta, v0)

4. Calibrate LSV Model Leverage Function

After having calibrated the LSV model the set up is ready for the pricing of FX TARFs.
